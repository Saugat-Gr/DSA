Kadane's Algorithm has the following approaches:


1. First We find the sum using a single loop as it is the optimized form of Brute Force Technique...

What our approach is: 


   an arr[] of n dimension, 

   Subarray: An array that is continious, basically a continious part of an array, 
 
  So, to find it's maximum sum of it's sub array take it's first number as it's maximum sum, 

  let it be the current sum, 
  move to next element add it until you find the maximum sum, 

  Keep in mind that if your curr sum becomes less than 0 make the curr sum to 0 because it's basically no point to add next num if you curr sum is less than 0 because it will rather decrase the curr sum only
